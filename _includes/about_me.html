           I love to learn new things.
           While hard engineering problems are often intrinsically fun to tackle,
           I'm most attracted to solving real customer problems with a business justification.
	  Continuous improvement is my hobby - that's why my knowledge is alwaus actual. 
	There is no any doubt that I can solve any problem - I am flexible and can learn anything in short time.
